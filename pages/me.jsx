            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>I am a full-stack software engineer. I am people-oriented, goal driven, hard working, and I adapt quickly in high stress situations. I offer strengths in connecting with others, learning quickly, and solving complex problems. Having helped build a Real Estate company from the ground up, I enjoy teaching myself new and challenging ideas.</p>
